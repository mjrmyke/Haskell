-- Combinatorics: In this lab, we are Integererested in finding *computational*
-- solutions to the kind of problems we looked at in class. So in addition to
-- working out mathematically how many possibilities there are, we'll be writing
-- code to *generate* all the possibilities, so that we can then count them
-- (using `length`) and check our work. In some cases, the possibilities may
-- be too difficult to count mathematically, in which case an algorithmic 
-- solution will have to suffice.

-- Problems
-- Note that for questions that ask "how many" possibilities there are, you
-- should write an *expression* (e.g., `length d6`) and not the actual value.
-- You should, of course, try to check the value Haskell gives you against 
-- the value the math says you should get. (But note that you should *not*
-- use the functions `fact`, `pm`, or `cm` here; those are for checking your
-- work, but the idea here is to actually *find* all the possible outcomes,
-- and then use the length to count them.)

-- How many ways are there to roll 4d6, if order is significant?
four_d6 = length (4`d`6)

-- How many distinct ways are there to roll 4d6, if order is not significant?
unorder_four_d6 = length (distinct (map sort (4`d`6)))

-- How many ways are there to roll 4d10, if we sum the rolls?
sum_four_d10 = length (map sum(4`d`10))

-- How many distinct ways are there to roll 4d10, summed?
sum_four_d10' = length (distinct (map sum(4`d`10)))

-- How many 5-card hands can be drawn from a standard 52-card deck, if 
-- order is significant?
five_card_hands = length (perms deck 5)

-- How many ways are there to rearrange the letters in the word POTATO,
-- not including indistinguishable rearrangements?
anagrams_potato = length (distinct (perms "POTATO" 6))

-- How many ways are there to roll 2d10 such that the first roll is less than
-- the second?
lt_2d10 = length [(x,y) | x <- d10, y <- d10, x>y]

-- Suppose we roll k `d` n. Of these, how many rolls will be sorted? You can
-- test for sorted-ness by writing a predicate that checks to see whether the
-- `sort` of a list is == to the original list.
sorted_rolls k n = length [ x | x <- k`d`n, isSorted x == True]

isSorted :: (Ord a) => [a] -> Bool
isSorted []       = True
isSorted [x]      = True
isSorted (x:y:xs) = x <= y && isSorted (y:xs)

-- How many ways are there to roll 2d10 such that the first roll evenly 
-- divides the second? By "a evenly divides b" we mean b `rem` a == 0.
-- (I'm not sure if there's a nice mathematical way to count these; let me know
-- if you find one!)
divides_2d10 = length [(x,y) | x <- d10, y <- d10, y`rem` x ==0]

-- Here's a die labeled with the sizes of the three smaller dice:
meta_die = [4,6,8]

-- Suppose we roll this die (= n) and a d6 (= k). We then roll k `d` n. 
-- How many outcomes are possible?
meta_meta_rolls = (fact (length [ x`d`y | x <- d4, y <- d10 ])) * (fact (length [ x`d`y | x <- d6, y <- d10 ])) * (fact (length [ x`d`y | x <- d8, y <- d10 ]))
-- As an optional exercise: try defining meta_die to include all the sizes of
-- dice. Can you get an answer before your computer explodes?

--   p1 .|| p2               Predicate that is True if EITHER p1 or p2 is
--   p1 .>< p2               Predicate that is True if ONE of p1 or p2 is
--   (not . p)               Predicate that is True if p1 is False, and vice versa
--   fact n                  Gives the factorial of n
--   pm n k                  Gives the number of permutations of n, size k

-- Combinatoric functions

-- distinct l
-- Given a list of (Ord-erable) items, `distinct` does two things:
-- 1. sorts the list
-- 2. removes duplicates
-- I.e., `distinct l` is a sorted, duplicate-free version of l. 
-- You can use this when we want to count the number of "distinct" possibilities.
distinct :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
distinct = dedup . sort
    where
        dedup [] = []
        dedup [x] = [x]
        dedup (x1:x2:xs) | x1 == x2   = dedup (x2:xs)
                        | otherwise   = x1 : dedup (x2:xs)

-- perms l k
-- Generates all k-sized permutations of l.
perms :: Eq a => [a] -> Integer -> [[a]]
perms _ 0 = [[]]
perms l r = [i:p | p <- pm', i <- l \\ p]
    where
        pm' = perms l (r-1)

-- combine k l
-- combine is the generalized version of `d`, that can work not just with
-- n-sided dice, but with any "base" collection of outcomes. For example
--   combine 4 d6
-- gives the same output as 
--   4 `d` 6
-- But you can use any list in place of `d6`.
combine :: Integer -> [a] -> [[a]]
combine 0 _ = [[]]
combine k l = concat [ map (i:) kcn' | i <- l ]
    where
        kcn' = combine (k-1) l

-- countWith p l
-- Count the number of elements of l that satisfy the predicate p. For example,
--   countWith odd d20    
--   ===> 10
countWith :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Integer
countWith f l = length $ filter f l

-- count e l
-- Count the number of times e is present in l. E.g.,
--   count 10 $ map sum $ 4 `d` 6
-- will count the number of ways to get a 10, if we roll 4d6 and sum the dice.
count :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Integer
count e = countWith (==e)

-- countDistinct l
-- Like distinct, this will sort l and remove any duplicates. However, it will
-- pair up each element of l with number of duplicates of it that existed in
-- the original list. E.g.,
--   countDistinct [1,1,1,2,2,3]
--   ===> [(3,1),(2,2),(1,3)]
countDistinct :: Ord a => [a] -> [(Integer,a)]
countDistinct l = [(count e l,e) | e <- distinct l]

-- Ordinarily the output of countDistinct is sorted by the outcomes. sortCounts
-- re-sorts based on the counts for each outcome.
sortCounts :: Ord a => [(a,b)] -> [(a,b)]
sortCounts = sortBy (comparing fst)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Predicate utilities
--
-- These functions make it (relatively) easy to combine predicates. E.g., 
-- suppose you are rolling 4d10 (summed) and you want to count all the outcomes
-- that are BOTH odd and >=10. While you could write your own predicate:
--   odd_ge10 x = odd x && x >= 10
--   ...
--   countWith odd_ge10 $ map sum $ 4 `d` 10
--   ===> ...
-- you can also just use the predicate combinators:
--   countWith (odd .&& (>=10)) $ map sum $ 4 `d` 10
--
-- Note that if you need to negate a predicate, you can use the built-in
-- `not` function like so:
--   countWith (not . odd) ...

-- Both
(.&&) :: (a -> Bool) -> (a -> Bool) -> (a -> Bool)
(.&&) f1 f2 x = (f1 x) && (f2 x)

-- Either
(.||) :: (a -> Bool) -> (a -> Bool) -> (a -> Bool)
(.||) f1 f2 x = (f1 x) && (f2 x)

-- Either, but not both
(.><) :: (a -> Bool) -> (a -> Bool) -> (a -> Bool)
(.><) f1 f2 x = (e1 || e2) && not (e1 && e2)
    where
        e1 = f1 x
        e2 = f2 x

-- Counting functions
-- As an aid to checking your work, these functions define the factorial,
-- P(n,k), and C(n,k).

fact :: Integer -> Integer
fact 0 = 1
fact n = product [1..n]

-- It's OK to use Integer div-ision here, because we know that the result will
