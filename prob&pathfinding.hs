-- Finishing up probability

-- Consider the city streets example I gave in class. We have a 5x5 city
-- block region, ranging from (0,0) to (5,5) (here I will use Cartesian
-- coordinates rather than street names, and I've limited the size to make the
-- problems tractable). First, in order to move around, we will need functions
-- to manipulate coordinates. Assuming that N is positive y, and E is positive
-- x, complete the definition of the functionn `move`, which takes a coordinate
-- pair and moves in the direction of the specified compass direction. E.g.,
--   move N (1,2)
--   ===> (1,3)
move :: CompassDir -> Coord -> Coord

-- A "path" is just a list of directions, e.g., [N,N,E,S,E].
type Path = [CompassDir]
-- Suppose we start at some point and follow a path through the streets, where
-- a path is a list of compass directions. Complete the definition of `follow`
-- which starts at a given point, follows a path, and returns the list of

---------------------------------------
-- OK, here's where the problems start:

-- is the probability that a random path will go from (0,0) to (5,5)?
goes_diagonal = prob ((5,5) `elem` ) [follow (0,0) z | z <- (all_paths 10)]


-- Again considering all the paths of length 10, what is the probability that
-- a path will intersect itself? (A path intersects itself if its `follow`
-- contains duplicates.) Note that "distinct" will do the wrong thing here,
-- because it will sort the path, rearranging the points. But you can use the
-- function `nub` to remove duplicates from a path without sorting it.

self_intersects = prob (/=11) (map length (map nub [follow (0,0) z | z <- (all_paths 10)]))




-- Consider all the paths of length 10, that go only N or E. What is the
-- probability that a random path will go from (0,0) to (5,5)?
ne_goes_diagonal = prob ((5,5) `elem` ) [follow (0,0) z | z <- (some_paths [N,E] 10)]

-- Consider the paths from the previous problem (length = 10, using only N or E).
-- What is the probability that a random path will cross the diagonal (i.e.,
-- that for any point on the path (x,y), y > x)? You may find it helpful to
-- define a helper function that tells you when a given point (x,y) is above
-- the diagonal.

--ne_crosses_diagonal = prob (==True)  (map (fst < last) [follow (0,0) z | z <- (some_paths [N,E] 10)])

-- The Monty Hall problem
-- We're going to build a simulation of the Monty Hall problem. We'll use
-- lists to represent the state of the doors (0 = empty, 1 = prize), so here
-- are all the possible configurations of doors:
doors :: [[Int]]
doors = [[1,0,0], [0,1,0], [0,0,1]]

-- For each door-configuration, there are three possible player-choices. Our
-- goal here is to pair each door with all three possible choices. We will
-- represent the combination of a door-config and a choice as a pair:
-- (choice, [doors...]). Complete the definition of the possible choices.
-- (Note that the resulting list should have 9 entries.)\\


choices :: [(Int,[Int])]
choices = [(a,[b]) | a <- [1..3], b <- doors]

-- other x y
-- `other` is a helper function for figuring out which door is the "other" door.
-- Given x and y, both 0 <= x,y < 3, with x /= y, `other x y` will return the
-- other value in that range that is not equal to either x or y.
other :: Int -> Int -> Int
other x y | x < 0 || y < 0 || x >= 3 || y >= 3 || x == y    =
    error "Invalid arguments to other."
other 0 y = (1 - y) + 2           -- y is either 1 or 2
other 1 y = (1 - (y `div` 2)) * 2 -- y is either 0 or 2
other 2 y = 1 - y                 -- y is either 0 or 1

-- indexOf a l
-- If you need to find which door is the winning door, you can use the built-in
-- function indexOf, which returns the index of a in the list l.
indexOf :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Int
indexOf a (a':as) | a == a'   = 0
                  | otherwise = 1 + indexOf a as

-- Now comes the tricky part: given an arrangement of doors and the player's
-- choice, the host's choice is almost determined, *except* in the case where
-- the player chose correctly. We'll write a function that will give us the
-- possible host choice(s), for each player choice+door. The idea is that
-- given
--   (player choice, [doors])
-- we will return
--   [(player choice, host choice, [doors]),
--    (player choice, host choice, [doors])]
-- where the player choice and the doors are the same, but the host's choice
-- is whatever it was forced to be. Note that the list has two elements, both
-- identical; this is so that the probabilities will work out correctly later.
-- In the case where the host has two choices, we'll return a list with *two*
-- *different* elements:
--   [(player choice, host choice 1, [doors]),
--    (player choice, host choice 2, [doors])]
host_chooses :: (Int,[Int]) -> [(Int,Int,[Int])]
host_chooses (pc, doors) = undefined

-- Now, for every possible choice in `choices`, we apply host_chooses to it
-- and stick all the results together to get a big list of all the possible ways
-- things could work out, for each doors arrangement, player choice (pc), and
-- host choice (hc).
--                    (pc, hc, doors)
all_possibilities :: [(Int,Int,[Int])]
all_possibilities = undefined

-- Given all the possibilities, what is the probability that the player's
-- first choice is correct (will result in a win)?
player_stay_prob = undefined

-- What is the probability that the "switch" choice would be correct?

-- Combinatorics and probability "library"
--
-- These are the combinatorics functions available for you to use. You can also
-- use any of the functions in the Prelude that you need, as well as `sort`,
-- imported from Data.List, above. In particular, you may find `map` and
-- `filter` useful.
--
-- Here's a quick reference to the definitions in this section:
--
--  Combinatoric functions:

--   countDistinct l         Pair each distinct element of l with its count
--   sortCounts ls           Sort the output of countDistinct on counts
--
--  Predicate combinators:
--   p1 .&& p2               Predicate that is True if BOTH p1 and p2 are
--   p1 .|| p2               Predicate that is True if EITHER p1 or p2 is
--   p1 .>< p2               Predicate that is True if ONE of p1 or p2 is
--   (not . p)               Predicate that is True if p1 is False, and vice versa
--
--  Probability functions:
--   prob f l                Calculates the probability of event f occuring in
--                           the list of outcomes l
--   when e f l              Calculates the conditional probability of f
--                           occuring in l, *assuming* that e has occured
--   average l               Given a list of numeric outcomes, calculates the
--                           average outcome.
--
--  Numeric functions:
--   fact n                  Gives the factorial of n
--   pm n k                  Gives the number of permutations of n, size k
--   cm n k                  Gives the number of combinations of n, size k

-- Combinatoric functions

-- distinct l
-- Given a list of (Ord-erable) items, `distinct` does two things:
-- 1. sorts the list
-- 2. removes duplicates
-- I.e., `distinct l` is a sorted, duplicate-free version of l.
-- You can use this when we want to count the number of "distinct" possibilities.

-- using the built-in `permutations` function.
derangements :: Eq a => [a] -> [[a]]
derangements l = filter (and . zipWith (/=) l) $ permutations l

-- combine k l
-- combine is the generalized version of `d`, that can work not just with
-- n-sided dice, but with any "base" collection of outcomes. For example
--   combine 4 d6
-- gives the same output as
--   4 `d` 6
-- But you can use any list in place of `d6`.

combine 0 _ = [[]]
combine k l = concat [ map (i:) kcn' | i <- l ]

-- countWith p l
-- Count the number of elements of l that satisfy the predicate p. For example,
--   countWith odd d20
--   ===> 10
countWith :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Int
countWith f l = length $ filter f l

-- count e l
-- Count the number of times e is present in l. E.g.,

count :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Int

-- countDistinct l

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Predicate utilities
--
-- These functions make it (relatively) easy to combine predicates. E.g.,
-- suppose you are rolling 4d10 (summed) and you want to count all the outcomes
-- that are BOTH odd and >=10. While you could write your own predicate:
--   odd_ge10 x = odd x && x >= 10
--   ...
--   countWith odd_ge10 $ map sum $ 4 `d` 10
--   ===> ...
-- you can also just use the predicate combinators:
--   countWith (odd .&& (>=10)) $ map sum $ 4 `d` 10
--
-- Note that if you need to negate a predicate, you can use the built-in
-- `not` function like so:
--   countWith (not . odd) ...

-- Both
(.&&) :: (a -> Bool) -> (a -> Bool) -> (a -> Bool)
(.&&) f1 f2 x = (f1 x) && (f2 x)

-- Either
(.||) :: (a -> Bool) -> (a -> Bool) -> (a -> Bool)
(.||) f1 f2 x = (f1 x) || (f2 x)

-- Either, but not both
(.><) :: (a -> Bool) -> (a -> Bool) -> (a -> Bool)

    where
        e1 = f1 x
        e2 = f2 x

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Probability functions

-- prob
-- prob will tell us the probability of event f occuring in the set of outcomes
-- l. For example, we could do
--
--   prob odd $ map sum $ 4 `d` 6
--
-- I.e., what is the probability of rolling an odd total, when we roll 4d6?
prob :: Eq a => (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Float

when e f l = prob f $ filter e l

-- Average outcome (for numeric outcomes). This is just the average of the
-- outcomes.
average :: Fractional a => [a] -> a
average l = (sum l) / (fromIntegral $ length l)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Counting functions
-- As an aid to checking your work, these functions define the factorial,
-- P(n,k), and C(n,k).
